Instructions for setting up the pi, flight controller, and sensors - assuming you have connected
the "normal drone" stuff (power dist, motors, etc.) already.

The pi communicates with the flight controller over GPIO 14 (TXD) and 15 (RXD). Wire 14 to the
RX of one of the flight controller's UARTs, and 15 to the TX so you have TX -> RX on both (I used
the UART marked TX5/RX5 on the Mamba, corresponding to UART 4 in betaflight?)
Once connected, set that UART to Serial RX in Betaflight, and from the main settings page set
the receiver to MSP.
